# Video Membership Website

Create a stripe account and put your stripe publishable key and secret key inside `settings.py` as well as your publishable key inside `checkout.js`

**Note** that you will need to create your own Stripe plans in your dashboard and link those plan ID's in your Django admin.


## Latest update of the code

Stripe changed their API to no longer allow a source being passed into a subscription. The code has been updated to now correctly bill a customer.
